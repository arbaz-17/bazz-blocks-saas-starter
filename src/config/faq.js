      answer:

      question: "Why Upgrade To Bazz Blocks Pro?",

        "Pro turns the starter into a full UI toolkit: multiple variants per section, deeper configuration, better dashboard building blocks, upgraded CRUD table patterns, and more chart options—so your product can scale without a UI rewrite.",

      id: "what-you-get-pro",
      question: "What’s The Biggest Difference You’ll Feel With Pro?",
      answer:

      question: "What Is NexBolt And When Do I Need It?",
      answer:
        "NexBolt is the full SaaS boilerplate: auth, multi-tenancy, billing hooks, database-ready backend, APIs, and integrations. If you want the UI and the backend foundation pre-wired, NexBolt is the fastest path.",

      id: "use-cases",
      question: "Who Is The Free Starter Best For?",
      answer:
        "Builders validating an idea, freelancers shipping a quick MVP, and teams who want a clean baseline. When you’re ready for more layouts, richer dashboards, and reusable patterns across products, Pro makes the jump painless.",

      id: "licensing",
      question: "Can I Use This For Client Work Or Commercial Projects?",
      answer:
        "Yes—use the starter to build and ship. If you’re building multiple client projects or want higher-leverage components (tables, dashboards, variants), upgrading to Pro saves time on every delivery.",

      id: "getting-started",
      question: "How Do I Customize This FAQ Fast?",
      answer:
        "Edit the questions and answers in this config file and your FAQ updates instantly. Start with pricing, product limits, and what’s included—then tailor it to your audience in a few minutes.",
